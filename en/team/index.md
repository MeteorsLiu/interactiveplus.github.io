## Main Theory

Determination, Passion, Respect, Intergrity, Honesty

InterActive+ aims to bring technology into practice and make programming more simple and productive.

"We eagerly want the power of innovation, but we have never forgot our initial dreams" This is what I discover on May 11, 2016.

The best achievement, the most beautiful sceneries and the most suffering things is only a tiny little part of this universe. So we decide, wherever we achieve in the future, our final goal is to fuel the development of the human beings.

We have never been lack of the power of innovation inside our group, but we may give up our amibitions and stop fighting for it. How many people does not fully understand one programming language and goes to another?

We can never lose our passion, and this article is not only for you who are supporting us, but also for ourselves to always get power and fuel ourselves, and finally we will achieve our greatest height.

InterActive+ strives to use a method that is appropriate for this time to convey a better message that does not belong to this time. We believe that every industry must be able to push the society forward to be meaningful. Since we are good at Computer Science, we hope to improve this world by open-sourcing.
